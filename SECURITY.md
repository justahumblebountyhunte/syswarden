# Security Policy

Being at the heart of it, Cyber Security is very important to me (Laurent Minne A.K.A. Duggy Tuxy)

## Supported Versions

I typically and primarily support the latest releases of my products for maintenance updates, but depending on the nature of the security issue I may issue hotfixes for arbitrarily earlier versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any issue regarding security, please disclose the information responsibly by sending an email to syswarden@data-shield.eu and not by creating a GitHub issue. I'll get back to you ASAP and work with you to confirm and plan a fix for the issue.

Please note that I do not currently offer a bug bounty program.
